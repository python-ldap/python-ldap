.. _text-bytes:

Bytes/text management
=====================

Python 3 introduces a hard distinction between *text* (``str``) – sequences of
characters (formally, *Unicode codepoints*) – and ``bytes`` – sequences of
8-bit values used to encode *any* kind of data for storage or transmission.

Python 2 has the same distinction between ``str`` (bytes) and
``unicode`` (text).
However, values can be implicitly converted between these types as needed,
e.g. when comparing or writing to disk or the network.
The implicit encoding and decoding can be a source of subtle bugs when not
designed and tested adequately.

In python-ldap 2.x (for Python 2), bytes were used for all fields,
including those guaranteed to be text.

From version 3.0, python-ldap uses text where appropriate.
On Python 2, the :ref:`bytes mode <bytes_mode>` setting influences how text is
handled.


What's text, and what's bytes
-----------------------------

The LDAP protocol states that some fields (distinguished names, relative
distinguished names, attribute names, queries) be encoded in UTF-8.
In python-ldap, these are represented as text (``str`` on Python 3,
``unicode`` on Python 2).

Attribute *values*, on the other hand, **MAY**
contain any type of data, including text.
To know what type of data is represented, python-ldap would need access to the
schema, which is not always available (nor always correct).
Thus, attribute values are *always* treated as ``bytes``.
Encoding/decoding to other formats – text, images, etc. – is left to the caller.


.. _bytes_mode:

The bytes mode
--------------

In Python 3, text values are represented as ``str``, the Unicode text type.

In Python 2, the behavior of python-ldap 3.0 is influenced by a ``bytes_mode``
argument to :func:`ldap.initialize`:

``bytes_mode=True`` (backwards compatible):
    Text values are represented as bytes (``str``) encoded using UTF-8.

``bytes_mode=False`` (future compatible):
    Text values are represented as ``unicode``.

If not given explicitly, python-ldap will default to ``bytes_mode=True``,
but if a ``unicode`` value is supplied to it, it will warn and use that value.

Backwards-compatible behavior is not scheduled for removal until Python 2
itself reaches end of life.


Errors, warnings, and automatic encoding
----------------------------------------

While the type of values *returned* from python-ldap is always given by
``bytes_mode``, for Python 2 the behavior for “wrong-type” values *passed in*
can be controlled by the ``bytes_strictness`` argument to
:func:`ldap.initialize`:

``bytes_strictness='error'`` (default if ``bytes_mode`` is specified):
  A ``TypeError`` is raised.

``bytes_strictness='warn'`` (default when ``bytes_mode`` is not given explicitly):
  A warning is raised, and the value is encoded/decoded
  using the UTF-8 encoding.

  The warnings are of type :class:`~ldap.LDAPBytesWarning`, which
  is a subclass of :class:`BytesWarning` designed to be easily
  :ref:`filtered out <filter-bytes-warning>` if needed.

``bytes_strictness='silent'``:
  The value is automatically encoded/decoded using the UTF-8 encoding.

On Python 3, ``bytes_strictness`` is ignored and a ``TypeError`` is always
raised.

When setting ``bytes_strictness``, an explicit value for ``bytes_mode`` needs
to be given as well.


Porting recommendations
-----------------------

Since end of life of Python 2 is coming in a few years, projects are strongly
urged to make their code compatible with Python 3. General instructions for
this are provided :ref:`in Python documentation <pyporting-howto>` and in the
`Conservative porting guide`_.

.. _Conservative porting guide: https://portingguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


When porting from python-ldap 2.x, users are advised to update their code
to set ``bytes_mode=False``, and fix any resulting failures.

The typical usage is as follows.
Note that only the result's *values* are of the ``bytes`` type:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> import ldap
    >>> con = ldap.initialize('ldap://localhost:389', bytes_mode=False)
    >>> con.simple_bind_s(u'login', u'secret_password')
    >>> results = con.search_s(u'ou=people,dc=example,dc=org', ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, u"(cn=Raphaël)")
    >>> results
    [
        ("cn=Raphaël,ou=people,dc=example,dc=org", {
            'cn': [b'Rapha\xc3\xabl'],
            'sn': [b'Barrois'],
        }),
    ]


.. _filter-bytes-warning:

Filtering warnings
------------------

The bytes mode warnings can be filtered out and ignored with a
simple filter.

.. code-block:: python

   import warnings
   import ldap

   if hasattr(ldap, 'LDAPBytesWarning'):
       warnings.simplefilter('ignore', ldap.LDAPBytesWarning)
