Installing python-ldap
######################

.. warning::

    You are reading documentation for an unreleased version.

    Following these instructions will currently get you version 2.5.2,
    which does not support Python 3.


Installing from PyPI
====================

The preferred point for downloading the “official” source distribution
is the `PyPI repository`_ which supports installing via `pip`_.
For example::

    $ python -m pip install python-ldap

.. _PyPI repository: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-ldap/
.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/

For installing from PyPI, you will need the same :ref:`build prerequisites`
as when installing from source.

We do not currently provide pre-built packages (wheels).


Furthermore, python-ldap requires the modules `pyasn1`_ and `pyasn1-modules`_.
``pip`` will install these automatically.

.. _pyasn1: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyasn1
.. _pyasn1-modules: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyasn1-modules


Pre-built Binaries
==================

Because distributions seem to be all over the place, this page
tries to list all the current ones we know of.

Note that the python-ldap team is not responsible for the binary packages
except the sources you can grab from the PyPI page. Also note that binary
packages are most times not up to date. If you experience troubles
with a binary package, it would be nice if you try to build a recent version
of python-ldap before submitting a bug report to make sure you did not
hit a problem already fixed in recent releases.

`openSUSE Linux <https://www.opensuse.org/>`_
---------------------------------------------

Ships with python-ldap and there's an additional
`download repository <https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/python/>`_
which contains builds of latest releases
(see also `OBS package <https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:languages:python/python-ldap>`_).

`Debian Linux <https://www.debian.org>`_
----------------------------------------

Have a look into the
`Debian Package Tracker <https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/python-ldap>`_
to get up to date information which versions are available.


Windows
-------

Unofficial packages for Windows are available on
`Christoph Gohlke's page <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_.


`FreeBSD <https://www.freebsd.org/>`_
-------------------------------------

The CVS repository of FreeBSD contains the package
`py-ldap <https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/net/py-ldap/>`_

Mac OS X
--------

You can install directly with pip::

    $ xcode-select --install
    $ pip install python-ldap \
        --global-option=build_ext \
        --global-option="-I$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/include/sasl"


.. _install-source:

Installing from Source
======================


python-ldap is built and installed using the Python setuptools.
From a source repository::

    $ python -m pip install setuptools
    $ python setup.py install

If you have more than one Python interpreter installed locally, you should
use the same one you plan to use python-ldap with.

Further instructions can be found in `Setuptools documentation`_.


.. _Setuptools documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/distributing/index.html


.. _build prerequisites:

Build prerequisites
===================

The following software packages are required to be installed
on the local system when building python-ldap:

- `Python`_ version 2.7, or 3.4 or later including its development files
- C compiler corresponding to your Python version (on Linux, it is usually ``gcc``)
- `OpenLDAP`_ client libs version 2.4.11 or later;
  it is not possible and not supported to build with prior versions.
- `OpenSSL`_ (optional)
- `Cyrus SASL`_ (optional)
- Kerberos libraries, MIT or Heimdal (optional)

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/
.. _OpenLDAP: https://www.openldap.org/
.. _OpenSSL: https://www.openssl.org/
.. _Cyrus SASL: https://www.cyrusimap.org/sasl/


Alpine
------

Packages for building::

    # apk add build-base openldap-dev python2-dev python3-dev

CentOS
------

Packages for building::

   # yum groupinstall "Development tools"
   # yum install openldap-devel python-devel

Debian
------

Packages for building and testing::

   # apt-get install build-essential python3-dev python2.7-dev \
       libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev slapd ldap-utils python-tox \
       lcov valgrind

Fedora
------

Packages for building and testing::

   # dnf install "@C Development Tools and Libraries" openldap-devel \
       python2-devel python3-devel python3-tox \
       lcov clang-analyzer valgrind

.. note::

   ``openldap-2.4.45-2`` (Fedora 26), ``openldap-2.4.45-4`` (Fedora 27) or
   newer are required.


setup.cfg
=========

The file setup.cfg allows to set some build and installation
parameters for reflecting the local installation of required
software packages. Only section ``[_ldap]`` is described here.
More information about other sections can be found in
`Setuptools documentation`_.

.. data:: library_dirs

   Specifies in which directories to search for required libraries.

.. data:: include_dirs

   Specifies in which directories to search for include files of required libraries.

.. data:: libs

   A space-separated list of library names to link to (see :ref:`libs-used-label`).

.. data:: extra_compile_args

   Compiler options.

.. data:: extra_objects



.. _libs-used-label:

Libraries used
---------------

.. data:: ldap
   :noindex:
.. data:: ldap_r
   :noindex:

   The LDAP protocol library of OpenLDAP. ``ldap_r`` is the reentrant version
   and should be preferred.

.. data:: lber
   :noindex:

   The BER encoder/decoder library of OpenLDAP.

.. data:: sasl2
   :noindex:

   The Cyrus-SASL library (optional)

.. data:: ssl
   :noindex:

   The SSL/TLS library of OpenSSL (optional)

.. data:: crypto
   :noindex:

   The basic cryptographic library of OpenSSL (optional)

Example
-------

The following example is for a full-featured build (including SSL and SASL support)
of python-ldap with OpenLDAP installed in a different prefix directory
(here ``/opt/openldap-2.4``) and SASL header files found in /usr/include/sasl.
Debugging symbols are preserved with compile option ``-g``.

::

  [_ldap]
  library_dirs = /opt/openldap-2.4/lib
  include_dirs = /opt/openldap-2.4/include /usr/include/sasl

  extra_compile_args = -g
  extra_objects =

  libs = ldap_r lber sasl2 ssl crypto
